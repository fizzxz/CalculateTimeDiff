# Convert Directory that contains images into a cbz/cbr

This project will require a root directory and format for the conversion cbz (zip) or cbr (rar ***Yet to be developed***).

Will also accept compression type, but will default to FastZip compression for cbz conversion as it faster than the Golang archive/zip in this project.
