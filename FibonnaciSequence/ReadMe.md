# Fibonnaci's sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers that follow a certain rule: each term of the sequence is equal to the sum of two preceding terms. This way, each term can be expressed by this equation:

Fₙ = Fₙ₋₂ + Fₙ₋₁

This project uses F₁ = 1 and F₂ = 1 as the sequence starters.
